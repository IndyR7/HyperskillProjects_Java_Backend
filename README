In the repository you can find all my solutions to the Java Hyperskill-projects. To find the descriptions of the tasks within a project and my solutions, do the following:

1.   Open any directory in the main-directory IndyR7_HyperSkillProjects_Java. In this directory you can find all files related to a certain project. 
        i.e. dir. Account Service
2.   To go to the directory containing the descriptions of a certain task, go to the directory with the same name as the project.
        i.e. dir. Account Service
3.   In here you can find all task descriptions and the final solution of the project. The final solution is in the task-folder, while the task descriptions are each in a seperate folder, 
      based on a certain stage in the project
        i.e. dir. Attention to business (task description from a certain stage) - dir. task (final solution of the project)
