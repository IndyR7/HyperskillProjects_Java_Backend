About:
This project demonstrates (in a simplified form) the principles of anti-fraud systems in the financial sector. For this project, we will work on a system with an expanded role model, a set of REST endpoints responsible for interacting with users, and an internal transaction validation logic based on a set of heuristic rules.


Learning outcomes:
Create a RESTful web service using SpringBoot, learn the basics of user authentication and authorization. Get to know the fundamentals of fraud detection and rule-based systems.


Stage 1:
Description
To begin with, let's define the concepts and find out what makes a good anti-fraud system. Consider the procedure of online payment (a transaction):

transaction

Frauds carry significant financial costs and risks for all stakeholders. So, the presence of an anti-fraud system is a necessity for any serious e-commerce platform.

Let's implement a simple anti-fraud system consisting of one rule — heuristics. In the beginning, there's one simple measure that prevents fraudsters from illegally transferring money from an account. Suppose some scammers acquired access to confidential financial information through phishing or pharming. They immediately try to transfer as much as possible. Most of the time, the account holder is not aware of the attack. The anti-fraud system should prevent it before it is too late.

In the first stage, you need to create a simple rest endpoint that calculates whether a transaction is ALLOWED, PROHIBITED, or requires MANUAL_PROCESSING by evaluating the amount of the transaction.

Objectives
Create and run a SpringBoot application on the 28852 port;

Create the POST /api/antifraud/transaction endpoint that accepts data in the JSON format:
{
  "amount": <Long>
}
Implement the following rules:
Transactions with a sum of lower or equal to 200 are ALLOWED;
Transactions with a sum of greater than 200 but lower or equal than 1500 require MANUAL_PROCESSING;
Transactions with a sum of greater than 1500 are PROHIBITED.
Transaction processing rules

The transaction amount must be greater than 0.
If the validation process was successful, the endpoint should respond with the status HTTP OK (200) and return the following JSON:
{
  "result": "<String>"
}
In case of wrong data in the request, the endpoint should respond with the status HTTP Bad Request (400).
Examples
Example 1: a POST request for /api/antifraud/transaction

Request body:

{
   "amount": 150
}
Response: 200 OK

Response body:

{
   "result": "ALLOWED"
}
Example 2: a POST request for /api/antifraud/transaction

Request body:

{
   "amount": 870
}
Response: 200 OK

Response body:

{
   "result": "MANUAL_PROCESSING"
}
Example 3: a POST request for /api/antifraud/transaction

Request body:

{
   "amount": 1700
}
Response: 200 OK

Response body:

{
   "result": "PROHIBITED"
}
Example 4: a POST request for /api/antifraud/transaction

Request body:

{
   "amount": -1
}
Response: 400 BAD REQUEST


Stage 2:
Description
Enterprise applications like anti-fraud systems are used by different types of users with various access levels. Different users should have different rights to access various system parts. Let's set up the authentication procedure for our system. Of course, you can elaborate it yourself, but it is considered good practice to use an already tested and reliable implementation. Fortunately, Spring includes the Spring Security module that contains the right methods.

In this stage, you need to provide the HTTP Basic authentication for our REST service with the JDBC implementations of UserDetailService for user management. You will require an endpoint for registering users at POST /api/auth/user.

To run the tests, the application.properties file should contain the following line: spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:../service_db.

You will also need some security dependencies in Gradle:

dependencies {
   ... other dependencies ...
   implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security'
}
Make sure that the CSRF is disabled to facilitate testing. We do not recommend disabling it in real-world projects. We suggest the following configuration:

@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    return http
            .httpBasic(Customizer.withDefaults())
            .csrf(CsrfConfigurer::disable)                           // For modifying requests via Postman
            .exceptionHandling(handing -> handing
                    .authenticationEntryPoint(restAuthenticationEntryPoint) // Handles auth error
            )
            .headers(headers -> headers.frameOptions().disable())           // for Postman, the H2 console
            .authorizeHttpRequests(requests -> requests                     // manage access
                    .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, "/api/auth/user").permitAll()
                    .requestMatchers("/actuator/shutdown").permitAll()      // needs to run test
                    // other matchers
            )
            .sessionManagement(session -> session
                    .sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS) // no session
            )
            // other configurations
            .build();
    }
Please note that /actuator/shutdown endpoint should be available to unauthorized users for testing purposes.

RestAuthenticationEntryPoint is an instance of the class that implements the AuthenticationEntryPoint interface. This endpoint handles authentication errors. For example:

public class RestAuthenticationEntryPoint implements AuthenticationEntryPoint {

    @Override
    public void commence(HttpServletRequest request,
                         HttpServletResponse response,
                         AuthenticationException authException) throws IOException, ServletException {
        response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_UNAUTHORIZED, authException.getMessage());
    }
}
Objectives
Add the Spring security to your project and configure the HTTP basic authentication;

For storing users and passwords, add a JDBC implementation of UserDetailsService with an H2 database. Usernames must be case insensitive;

Add the POST /api/auth/user endpoint. In this stage, It must be available to unauthorized users for registration and accept data in the JSON format:

{
   "name": "<String value, not empty>",
   "username": "<String value, not empty>",
   "password": "<String value, not empty>"
}
If a user has been successfully added, the endpoint must respond with the HTTP CREATED status (201) and the following body:

{
   "id": <Long value, not empty>,
   "name": "<String value, not empty>",
   "username": "<String value, not empty>"
}
If an attempt to register an existing user was a failure, the endpoint must respond with the HTTP CONFLICT status (409);

If a request contains wrong data, the endpoint must respond with the BAD REQUEST status (400);

Add the GET /api/auth/list endpoint. It must be available to all authorized users;

The endpoint must respond with the HTTP OK status (200) and the body with an array of objects representing the users sorted by ID in ascending order. Return an empty JSON array if there's no information:

[
    {
        "id": <user1 id>,
        "name": "<user1 name>",
        "username": "<user1 username>"
    },
     ...
    {
        "id": <userN id>,
        "name": "<userN name>",
        "username": "<userN username>"
    }
]
Add the DELETE /api/auth/user/{username} endpoint, where {username} specifies the user that should be deleted. The endpoint must be available to all authorized users. The endpoint must delete the user and respond with the HTTP OK status (200) and the following body:

{
   "username": "<username>",
   "status": "Deleted successfully!"
}
If a user is not found, respond with the HTTP Not Found status (404);

Change the POST /api/antifraud/transaction endpoint; it must be available only to all authorized users.

Examples
Example 1: a POST request for /api/auth/user with the correct user information

Request body:

{
   "name": "John Doe",
   "username": "JohnDoe",
   "password": "secret"
}
Response: 201 CREATED

Response body:

{
   "id": 1,
   "name": "John Doe",
   "username": "JohnDoe"
}
Example 2: a POST request for /api/auth/user with the occupied email

Request body:

{
   "name": "John Doe",
   "username": "JohnDoe",
   "password": "secret"
}
Response: 409 CONFLICT

Example 3: a POST request for /api/auth/user with the wrong format of the user JSON

Request body:

{
   "name": "John Doe",
   "password": "secret"
}
Response: 400 BAD REQUEST

Example 4: a GET request for /api/auth/list

Response: 200 OK

[
  {
    "name":"John Doe",
    "username":"JohnDoe",
  },
  {
    "name":"JohnDoe2",
    "username":"JohnDoe2",
  }
]
Example 5: a DELETE request for /api/auth/user/johndoe

Response: 200 OK

{
   "username": "JohnDoe",
   "status": "Deleted successfully!"
}



Stage 3:
Description
An enterprise anti-fraud system has hundreds of merchant users who take advantage of the system by checking the validity of the transactions only. These users do not want to delve into a list of stolen cards, suspicious IP addresses, and who else uses the app. On the other hand, the number of users responsible for reporting stolen cards/IPs and excluding them from the blacklist is limited. These users don't have access to user-management functions. Finally, we have several users who are 100%-trusted and are allowed to access and modify more sensitive data.

In this stage, you need to add the authorization feature. Authorization is a process when the system decides whether an authenticated client has permission to access the requested resource. Authorization always follows authentication.

Let's implement the role model for our system:

Anonymous	MERCHANT	ADMINISTRATOR	SUPPORT
POST /api/auth/user	+	+	+	+
DELETE /api/auth/user	-	-	+	-
GET /api/auth/list	-	-	+	+
POST /api/antifraud/transaction	-	+	-	-
PUT /api/auth/access	-	-	+	-
PUT /api/auth/role	-	-	+	-
Let's talk about roles. ADMINISTRATOR is the user who has registered first, all other users should receive the MERCHANT roles. All users added after ADMINISTRATOR must be locked by default and unlocked later by ADMINISTRATOR. The SUPPORT role should be assigned by ADMINISTRATOR to one of the users later.

Objectives
Add authorization to the service and implement the role model shown in the table above. The first registered user should receive the ADMINISTRATOR role; the rest — MERCHANT. In case of authorization violation, respond with the HTTP Forbidden status (403). Mind that only one role can be assigned to a user;
All users, except ADMINISTRATOR, must be locked immediately after registration; only ADMINISTRATOR can unlock users;
Change the response for the POST /api/auth/user endpoint. It should respond with the HTTP Created status (201) and the body with the JSON object containing the information about a user. Add the role field in the response:
{
   "id": <Long value, not empty>,
   "name": "<String value, not empty>",
   "username": "<String value, not empty>",
   "role": "<String value, not empty>"
}
Change the response for the GET /api/auth/list endpoint. Add the role field in the response:
[
    {
        "id": <user1 id>,
        "name": "<user1 name>",
        "username": "<user1 username>",
        "role": "<user1 role>"
    },
     ...
    {
        "id": <userN id>,
        "name": "<userN name>",
        "username": "<userN username>",
        "role": "<userN role>"
    }
]
Add the PUT /api/auth/role endpoint that changes user roles. It must accept the following JSON body:
{
   "username": "<String value, not empty>",
   "role": "<String value, not empty>"
}
If successful, respond with the HTTP OK status (200) and the body like this:

{
   "id": <Long value, not empty>,
   "name": "<String value, not empty>",
   "username": "<String value, not empty>",
   "role": "<String value, not empty>"
}
If a user is not found, respond with the HTTP Not Found status (404);
If a role is not SUPPORT or MERCHANT, respond with HTTP Bad Request status (400);
If you want to assign a role that has been already provided to a user, respond with the HTTP Conflict status (409);
Add the PUT /api/auth/access endpoint that locks/unlocks users. It accepts the following JSON body:
{
   "username": "<String value, not empty>",
   "operation": "<[LOCK, UNLOCK]>"  // determines whether the user will be activated or deactivated
}
If successful, respond with the HTTP OK status (200) and the following body:

{
    "status": "User <username> <[locked, unlocked]>!"
}
For safety reasons, ADMINISTRATOR cannot be blocked. In this case, respond with the HTTP Bad Request status (400);
If a user is not found, the endpoint must respond with HTTP Not Found status (404).
Examples
Example 1: a POST request for /api/auth/user with the correct user credentials

Request body:

{
   "name": "John Doe",
   "username": "JohnDoe",
   "password": "secret"
}
Response: 201 CREATED

Response body:

{
   "id": 1,
   "name": "John Doe",
   "username": "JohnDoe",
   "role": "ADMINISTRATOR"
}
Example 2: a GET request for /api/auth/list

Response: 200 OK

[
  {
    "name":"John Doe",
    "username":"JohnDoe",
    "role": "ADMINISTRATOR"
  },
  {
    "name":"JohnDoe2",
    "username":"JohnDoe2",
    "role": "MERCHANT"
  }
]
Example 3: a PUT request for /api/auth/role with the correct authentication under the ADMINISTRATOR role:

Request body:

{
   "username": "JohnDoe1",
   "role": "SUPPORT"
}
Response: 200 OK

Response body:

{
   "id": 1,
   "name": "John Doe 1",
   "username": "JohnDoe1",
   "role": "SUPPORT"
}
Example 4: a PUT request for /api/auth/role with the correct authentication under the ADMINISTRATOR role:

Request body:

{
   "username": "JohnDoe1",
   "role": "ADMINISTRATOR"
}
Response: 400 HTTP Bad Request

Example 5: a PUT request for /api/auth/role with the correct authentication under the ADMINISTRATOR role:

Request body:

{
   "username": "JohnDoe1",
   "role": "SUPPORT"
}
Response: 409 HTTP Conflict

Example 6: a PUT request for /api/auth/access with the correct authentication under the ADMINISTRATOR role:

Request body:

{
   "username": "JohnDoe1",
   "operation": "UNLOCK"
}
Response: 200 OK

Response body:

{
   "status": "User JohnDoe1 unlocked!"
}
Example 7: a PUT request for /api/auth/access with the correct authentication under the ADMINISTRATOR role:

Request body:

{
   "username": "Administrator",
   "operation": "LOCK"
}
Response: 400 Bad Request


Stage 4:
Description
Usually, hackers use certain IP addresses. As a result, you should be cautious about activities coming from these addresses. In addition, card numbers can be reported as stolen. The anti-fraud system should prohibit all transactions with stolen cards.

In this stage, we need to enable our anti-fraud system to retrieve a list of prohibited card numbers and suspicious IP addresses to ban them from carrying out any transactions.

In our service, we will check IP addresses for compliance with IPv4. Any address following this format consists of four series of numbers from 0 to 255 separated by dots. Here is an example of a valid IP address: 132.245.4.216

Card numbers must be checked according to the Luhn algorithm. During testing, we will use the following card format: 4000008449433403.

The first six digits are the Issuer Identification Number (IIN). The first digit is the Major Industry Identifier (MII);
The seventh to second-to-last digits indicate the customer account number;
The last digit is the check digit (or checksum). It validates the credit card number using the Luhn algorithm.
So, 16 digits in total.

Tip: If you want to know more about Luhn algorithms, take a look at the Wikipedia page of the same name or complete the Simple Banking System project on Hyperskill.

Objectives
Change the role model:

POST api/auth/user	+	+	+	+
DELETE api/auth/user	-	-	+	-
GET api/auth/list	-	-	+	+
POST api/antifraud/transaction	-	+	-	-
POST, DELETE, GET api/antifraud/suspicious-ip	-	-	-	+
POST, DELETE, GET api/antifraud/stolencard	-	-	-	+
Add the POST /api/antifraud/suspicious-ip endpoint that saves suspicious IP addresses to the database. It must accept the following JSON body:
{
   "ip": "<String value, not empty>"
}
If successful, respond with the HTTP Created status (200) and the body like this:

{
   "id": "<Long value, not empty>",
   "ip": "<String value, not empty>"
}
If an IP is already in the database, respond with the HTTP Conflict status (409).

If an IP address has the wrong format, respond with the HTTP Bad Request status (400).

Add the DELETE /api/antifraud/suspicious-ip/{ip} endpoint that deletes IP addresses from the database. If IP addresses are deleted successfully, respond with the HTTP OK status (200) and the body like this:
{
   "status": "IP <ip address> successfully removed!"
}
If an IP is not found in the database, respond with the HTTP Not Found status (404).

If an IP address has the wrong format (not following the Description section rules), respond with the HTTP Bad Request status (400)

Add the GET /api/antifraud/suspicious-ip endpoint that shows IP addresses in the database. Endpoint must respond with the HTTP OK status (200) and body with an array of JSON objects representing IP address sorted by ID in ascending order (or an empty array if the database is empty):
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "ip": "192.168.1.1"
    },
     ...
    {
        "id": 100,
        "ip": "192.168.1.254"
    }
]
or

[]
Add the POST /api/antifraud/stolencard endpoint that saves stolen card data in the database. It must accept the following JSON body:
{
   "number": "<String value, not empty>"
}
If successful, respond with the HTTP Created status (200) and the following body:

{
   "id": "<Long value, not empty>",
   "number": "<String value, not empty>"
}
If the card number is already in the database, respond with the HTTP Conflict status (409).

If a card number has the wrong format, respond with the HTTP Bad Request status (400).

Add the DELETE /api/antifraud/stolencard/{number} endpoint that deletes a card number from the database. If a card number has been deleted, respond with the HTTP OK status (200) and the body below:
{
   "status": "Card <number> successfully removed!"
}
If a card number is not found in the database, respond with the HTTP Not Found status (404).

If a card number follows the wrong format (look at the Description section), respond with HTTP Bad Request status (400).

Add the GET /api/antifraud/stolencard endpoint that shows card numbers stored in the database. The endpoint must respond with the HTTP OK status (200) and a body with an array of JSON objects that display the card numbers sorted by ID in ascending order (or an empty array if the database is empty):
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "number": "4000008449433403"
    },
     ...
    {
        "id": 100,
        "number": "4000009455296122"
    }
]
Change the POST /api/antifraud/transaction, now endpoint must accept data in the following JSON format:
{
  "amount": <Long>,
  "ip": "<String value, not empty>",
  "number": "<String value, not empty>"
}
Implement the following rules in addition to the previous ones:
If an IP address is in the blacklist, the transaction is PROHIBITED;
If a card number is in the blacklist, the transaction is PROHIBITED.
If the validation process was successful, the endpoint should respond with the status HTTP OK (200) and return the following JSON:
{
  "result": <String>,
  "info": <String>
}
If the result is ALLOWED, the info field must be set to none (a string value).

In the case of PROHIBITED or MANUAL_PROCESSING, the info field must contain the reason for rejecting the transaction; the reason must be separated by , and sorted alphabetically. For example, amount, card-number, ip.

If a request contains wrong data, an IP address and a card number must be validated as described in the Description section, the endpoint should respond with the status HTTP Bad Request (400).

}


Stage 5:
Description
In the current implementation, our system is very basic; each transaction is considered in isolation from others. Let's add correlation to our fraud detection rules. Now, the result of the operation depends on other operations.

Let's enrich the transaction event with the world region and the transaction date. There is the table for world region codes:

Code	Description
EAP	East Asia and Pacific
ECA	Europe and Central Asia
HIC	High-Income countries
LAC	Latin America and the Caribbean
MENA	The Middle East and North Africa
SA	South Asia
SSA	Sub-Saharan Africa
Objectives
Implement the transaction history. Save ALL transactions, even PROHIBITED ones, in the database.

Change the POST /api/antifraud/transaction. Now, the endpoint must accept data in the following JSON format:
{
  "amount": <Long>,
  "ip": "<String value, not empty>",
  "number": "<String value, not empty>",
  "region": "<String value, not empty>",
  "date": "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss"
}
Change the rules for reviewing a transaction. A transaction containing a card number is PROHIBITED if:
There are transactions from more than 2 regions of the world other than the region of the transaction that is being verified in the last hour in the transaction history;
There are transactions from more than 2 unique IP addresses other than the IP of the transaction that is being verified in the last hour in the transaction history.
A transaction containing a card number is sent for MANUAL_PROCESSING if:
There are transactions from 2 regions of the world other than the region of the transaction that is being verified in the last hour in the transaction history;
There are transactions from 2 unique IP addresses other than the IP of the transaction that is being verified in the last hour in the transaction history.
If the validation process was successful, the endpoint should respond with the status HTTP OK (200) and return the following JSON:
{
  "result": <String>,
  "info": <String>
}
If the result is ALLOWED, the info field must be set to none.

In the case of the PROHIBITED or MANUAL_PROCESSING result, the info field must contain the reason for rejecting the transaction. The reason must be separated by , and sorted alphabetically. For example, amount, card-number, ip, ip-correlation, region-correlation.

If a request contains wrong data, the region and date must be validated as described above, but the endpoint should respond with the status HTTP Bad Request (400).

Examples
Example 1: a POST request for /api/antifraud/transaction

Request body:

{
  "amount": 150,
  "ip": "192.168.1.1",

  "region": "EAP",
  "date": "2022-01-22T16:04:00"
}
Response: 200 OK

Response body:

{
   "result": "ALLOWED",
   "info": "none"
}
Example 2: a POST request for /api/antifraud/transaction; wrong date format

Request body:

{
  "amount": 150,
  "ip": "192.168.1.1",
  "number": "4000008449433403",
  "region": "EAP",
  "date": "2022-13-22T16:04:00"
}
Response: 400 BAD REQUEST

Example 3: a POST request for /api/antifraud/transaction; wrong region

Request body:

{
  "amount": 150,
  "ip": "192.168.1.1",
  "number": "4000008449433403",
  "region": "EAPP",
  "date": "2022-13-22T16:04:00"

Stage 6:
Description
When working on an anti-fraud system, it is necessary to consider that the environment of transactions is constantly changing. There are many factors like the country's economy, the behavior of fraudsters, and the number of transactions happening concurrently that influence what we can call fraud. It is necessary to add certain adaptation mechanisms to our service, such as feedback. Feedback will be carried out manually by a SUPPORT specialist for completed transactions. Based on the feedback results, we will change the limits of fraud detection algorithms following the special rules. Take a look at the table below that shows the logic of our feedback system:

Transaction Feedback →
Transaction Validity ↓	ALLOWED	MANUAL_PROCESSING	PROHIBITED
ALLOWED	Exception	↓ max ALLOWED	
↓ max ALLOWED

↓ max MANUAL

MANUAL_PROCESSING	↑ max ALLOWED	Exception	↓ max MANUAL
PROHIBITED	
↑ max ALLOWED

↑ max MANUAL

↑ max MANUAL	Exception
The formula for increasing the limit:

new_limit = 0.8 * current_limit + 0.2 * value_from_transaction
The formula for decreasing the limit:

new_limit = 0.8 * current_limit - 0.2 * value_from_transaction
If the new value is fractional, round it up (use ceil).

Let's take an example:

Current max ALLOWED limit is 200. A transaction of 210 is validated for MANUAL_PROCESSING. The feedback has been received that a transaction with a value 210 is ALLOWED. Max ALLOWED value must be updated to 202:

202 = 0.8 * 200 + 0.2 * 210
Consider the following limitations for feedback:

For each transaction, only one feedback is allowed.
Feedback is provided only by users with SUPPORT role.
Objectives
Change the role model:
Anonymous	MERCHANT	ADMINISTRATOR	SUPPORT
POST /api/auth/user	+	+	+	+
DELETE /api/auth/user	-	-	+	-
GET /api/auth/list	-	-	+	+
POST /api/antifraud/transaction	-	+	-	-
/api/antifraud/suspicious-ip	-	-	-	+
/api/antifraud/stolencard	-	-	-	+
GET /api/antifraud/history	-	-	-	+
PUT /api/antifraud/transaction	-	-	-	+
Add the PUT method to the /api/antifraud/transaction endpoint that adds feedback for a transaction. It must accept the following JSON body:
{
   "transactionId": <Long>,
   "feedback": "<String>"
}
If successful, update the limits of transaction validation following the table above and respond with the HTTP OK status (200) and the following body:

{
  "transactionId": <Long>,
  "amount": <Long>,
  "ip": "<String value, not empty>",
  "number": "<String value, not empty>",
  "region": "<String value, not empty>",
  "date": "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss",
  "result": "<String>",
  "feedback": "<String>"
}
If the feedback for a specified transaction is already in the database, respond with the HTTP Conflict status (409).

If the feedback has the wrong format (other than ALLOWED, MANUAL_PROCESSING, PROHIBITED), respond with the HTTP Bad Request status (400).

If the feedback throws an Exception following the table, respond with the HTTP Unprocessable Entity status (422).

If the transaction is not found in history, respond with the HTTP Not Found status (404).

Add the GET /api/antifraud/history endpoint that shows the transaction history. The endpoint must respond with the HTTP OK status (200) and a body with an array of JSON objects that represent transactions sorted by ID in ascending order (or an empty array if the history is empty):
[
    {
      "transactionId": <Long>,
      "amount": <Long>,
      "ip": "<String value, not empty>",
      "number": "<String value, not empty>",
      "region": "<String value, not empty>",
      "date": "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss",
      "result": "<String>",
      "feedback": "<String>"
    },
     ...
    {
      "transactionId": <Long>,
      "amount": <Long>,
      "ip": "<String value, not empty>",
      "number": "<String value, not empty>",
      "region": "<String value, not empty>",
      "date": "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss",
      "result": "<String>",
      "feedback": "<String>"
    }
]
or

[]
Add the GET /api/antifraud/history/{number} endpoint that shows the transaction history for a specified card number. If transactions for a specified card number are found, respond with the HTTP OK status (200) and the following body:
[
    {
      "transactionId": <Long>,
      "amount": <Long>,
      "ip": "<String value, not empty>",
      "number": number,
      "region": "<String value, not empty>",
      "date": "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss",
      "result": "<String>",
      "feedback": "<String>"
    },
     ...
    {
      "transactionId": <Long>,
      "amount": <Long>,
      "ip": "<String value, not empty>",
      "number": number,
      "region": "<String value, not empty>",
      "date": "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss",
      "result": "<String>",
      "feedback": "<String>"
    }
]
If transactions for a specified card number are not found, respond with the HTTP Not Found status (404).

If a card number doesn't follow the right format like in previous stages, respond with HTTP Bad Request status (400).
